# Slide 2a

``` javascript
const A = x => ({B: x})
```

# Slide 2b

A little bit of inline styling, <span style="color: red">like so</span>.

# Slide 3

Testing inline formatting for Max/MSP slides: this is a Max <span class="max-obj">object</span>,
this is a <span class="max-msg">message</span>.

# Slide 4x

Image test:

<div class="image-h-400">

![](assets/hookup.jpg)

</div>

# Slide 5

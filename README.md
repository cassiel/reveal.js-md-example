# `reveal.js-md-example`

Testing NPM-installed Reveal.js with Markdown slides

## Usage

Install Reveal.js from NPM:

    npm install reveal.js

(or just `npm install` if checking out from GitHub.)

Make sure the `data-markdown` attribute in `index.html` points to an existing Markdown file of slides, formatted as documented [here](https://revealjs.com/markdown/).

Fire up a local web server (with `python -m http.server` or some Node-based equivalent).
